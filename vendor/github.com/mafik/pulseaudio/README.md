Package pulseaudio is a pure-Go (no libpulse) implementation of the PulseAudio native protocol.

Rather than exposing the PulseAudio protocol directly this library attempts to hide
the PulseAudio complexity behind a Go interface.
Some of the things which are deliberately not exposed in the API are:

→ backwards compatibility for old PulseAudio servers

→ transport mechanism used for the connection (Unix sockets / memfd / shm)

→ encoding used in the pulseaudio-native protocol

## Working features
Querying and setting the volume.

Listing audio outputs.

Changing the default audio output.

Notifications on config updates.
